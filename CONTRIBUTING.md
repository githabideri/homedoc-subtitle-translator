# Contributing

Thanks for improving **homedoc-subtitle-translator**! To keep the project easy
to review and ship, please follow these guidelines:

1. Keep pull requests small, focused, and well-tested.
2. Update documentation alongside behaviour changes.
3. For releases:
   - bump `__version__` in `setzer_cli.py` (or in the shared version module if we add one),
   - update the changelog section in `README.md` if present,
   - tag the release and push the tag after merging.

Issues and PRs are welcome. Please keep discussions respectful and actionable.
